**Replica Set** - a few connected machines that store the same data to ensure that if something happens to one of the machines the data will remain intact. Comes from the word replicate - to copy something.

**Instance** - a single machine locally or in the cloud, running a certain software, in our case it is the MongoDB database.

**Cluster** - group of servers that store your data.
